# Java Streams Assignment

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to provide hands-on experience with Java streams and functional programming
concepts. You will be working with a simple domain model representing a collection of books and authors.

## Domain Model

We have provided a simple domain model representing a collection of books and authors and a library.

## Assignments

1. **Look at the sample data**
    - See the sample data in the `Main` class.
2. **Filter books published after a certain Year**
    - Use streams to filter and print books published after a specified year.
3. **Calculate Total Price of Books**
    - Calculate and print the total price of all books in the library.
4. **Find the author with the most books**
    - Find and print the author who has written the most books.
5. **Sort books by title**
    - Sort the books alphabetically by title and print the sorted list.
6. **Group books by author**
    - Group the books by author and print the result.
7. **Find the average age of authors**
    - Calculate and print the average age of all authors. Hint: there is an `average()` method on a `DoubleStream`.
8. **Additional Stream Operations**
    - Explore additional stream operations, such as `map`, `flatMap`, or any other interesting operations. Implement at least one additional operation and explain its purpose.
