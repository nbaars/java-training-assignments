# Sum

Write a Java program to display n terms of natural numbers and their sum.

```

Expected output : 28
```

# Triangle

Write a Java program to print Floyd's Triangle.

```
Input number of rows: 5
Expected output :
1 
2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 10 
11 12 13 14 15 
```

# Palindrome

Write a Java program to check if a string is a palindrome or not, it's a palindrome if it remains the same on reversal.

```
"training" is not a palindrome, as its reverse is "gniniart”.
"dad" is a palindrome, as its reverse is "dad," 
"j", "mom", "madam", "ab1ba", “12321.”
```

## Java constructs

```java
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

```java
if (i == 0) {
    System.out.println("i is zero");
} else if (i == 1) {
    System.out.println("i is one");
} else {
    System.out.println("i is greater than one");
}
```

```java
String str = "33233";
char c = str.charAt(0);
```

```java
int sum = 0;
sum = sum + 1;
```
