## Java Zip File Manipulation

### Introduction

In this assignment is to provide hands-on experience with Java's `java.util.zip` package for working with zip files.
This assignment will cover creating, extracting, and modifying zip files.

#### Zip file creation:

Write code that creates a Zip file named `sample.zip`.
Add a few text files to the Zip file, each containing some sample content. Use ZipOutputStream for this task.

#### Zip file extraction:

Implement code that extracts the contents of the `sample.zip` file.
Ensure that the extracted files are saved in a directory named `extracted_files`

#### Adding files to existing zip:

Extend the code to add additional files to the existing `sample.zip.`
Add at least one new text file to the zip file.

#### Reading contents of zip file:

Write code that reads and prints the names of all files present in the `sample.zip` without extracting them.
Utilize `ZipInputStream` for reading zip entries.
